# MessageToHyrum

Hello Hyrum, I wasn't sure how to reach you so hopefully you are able to find this message. I was wondering if you could delete/remove the GroupMeAnalyzer repository from your account (or at least make it private). I've made it private since you've contributed since I realized my personal chat data does not need to be on the public web, but it seems to still be public on your account. I'm not extrememly familiar with all of Git's tools so if there is something I can do on my end to make this happen please let me know. My email is mrr17matt@gmail.com if you would like to respond.

Thank you.
